# Usage

1. download chrome driver from https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
2. the script is built to use the default user profile and cookie, so login to osu! before running this script
3. In order not to be banned from osu! admin for scripting their website, this script is single threaded (Also, I am lazy to build it with multi-threading) and is going to be very slow. Expecting several hours to days to dump all your scores dependent on number of maps you have played
4. If your network condition is not stable, change the script a longer page loading wait time (last row)
